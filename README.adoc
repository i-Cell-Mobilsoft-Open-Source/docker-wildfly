== Project structure

=== /dockerfile
Collection of the dockerfiles.
For a detailed description of the docker image created, see https://i-cell-mobilsoft-open-source.github.io/docker-wildfly/[Docker Wildfly Images].

=== /script
Common scripts that are also used by dockerimages,
but can also be used on their own.

== Development
All you need to know is the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f <PATH>/docker-compose-1.yml build
docker compose -f <PATH>/docker-compose-2.yml build
docker compose -f <PATH>/docker-compose-3.yml build

[IMPORTANT]
====
The release and docker push commands MUST be handled exclusively by Github Actions! 
====

== Release
The release is done by Github Actions.
Basically we handle 2 cases:

. *Major, Minor version* - major version release, can only be generated from *master branch*.
. *Bugfix version* - can only be generated from *release branch*.

The associated CI appears only for the corresponding branches.
