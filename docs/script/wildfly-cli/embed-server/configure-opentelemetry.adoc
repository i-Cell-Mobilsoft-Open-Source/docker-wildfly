|OPENTELEMETRY_SERVICE_NAME |opentelemetry.service-name |ROOT.war | Service name reported to the trace collector
|OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER_TYPE |opentelemetry.exporter-type |jaeger
a| The name of the exporter to use:

* jaeger
* otlp

|OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT |opentelemetry.exporter.endpoint |http://localhost:14250 |The URL for the exporter endpoint.
|OPENTELEMETRY_SPAN_PROCESSOR_TYPE |opentelemetry.span-processor.type |batch
a|The type of span processor to use:

* batch: The default processor, which sends traces in batches as configured via the remaining attributes
* simple: Traces are pushed to the exporter as they finish.

|OPENTELEMETRY_SPAN_PROCESSOR_BATCH_DELAY |opentelemetry.span-processor.batch-delay |5000 |The interval, in milliseconds, between two consecutive exports.
|OPENTELEMETRY_SPAN_PROCESSOR_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE |opentelemetry.span-processor.max-queue-size |2048 |The maximum size of the queue before traces are dropped
|OPENTELEMETRY_SPAN_PROCESSOR_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE |opentelemetry.span-processor.max-export-batch-size |512 |The maximum number of traces that are published in each batch, which must be smaller or equal to `max-queue-size`
|OPENTELEMETRY_SPAN_PROCESSOR_EXPORT_TIMEOUT |opentelemetry.span-processor.export-timeout |30000 |The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to allow for an export to complete before being cancelled
|OPENTELEMETRY_SAMPLER_RATIO |opentelemetry.sampler.ratio |0.01 |The value used to configure the ratio sampler, which must be within [0.0, 1.0].For example, if 1 trace in 10,000 is to be exported, this value would be 0.0001.
|OPENTELEMETRY_SAMPLER_TYPE |opentelemetry.sampler.type |ratio
a| The type of sampler to use:

* on: Always on (all traces are recorded)
* off: Always off (no traces are recorded)
* ratio: Return a ratio of the traces (e.g., 1 trace in 10000).
